# IAT-Women-In-Science
This repository uses open source data from Harvard Implicit Association Tests to create graphics for a Women in Science event

The tests can be completed here: https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html

The data can be accessed here: https://osf.io/y9hiq/

Data from the Gender-Career IAT between 2005 and 2019, and from the Gender-Science IAT between 2003 and 2019 were downloaded and the R code here was used to create visualisations of the data.

Two complex graphical outcomes from the code are the map of Europe showing the mean score for each country and the Sankey plots which visualise the numbers of men/women and age groups in different levels of bias.

Bias was grouped as being strong, moderate or weak based on Cohen 1977.
