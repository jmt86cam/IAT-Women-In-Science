# IAT - Women in Science

An analysis of Harvard Implicit Association Test data centred around Women in Science. This was completed to provide supporting visualisations for a TU Delft exhibition and more context can be [found here](about).

Using R it was possible to plot the association of words relating to "Male" with "Science" and "Career", as opposed to pairing "Female" words with these or pairing "Male" words to words associated with "Arts" and "Family" respectively. The R scripts are available [here](https://github.com/jmt86cam/IAT-Women-In-Science/tree/main).

Bias could also be plotted across Europe, with increasing levels of association between words relating to "Male" and "Science" or "Career" being represented by darker colour.

Finally Sankey plots were made to identify which groups most contributed towards bias. A strong-weak bias was assigned according to Cohen (1977). Age and Gender were examined:

One observation from the above plots is that there are more women and younger people participating. Age is an expected difference due to varying levels of computer literacy however women outnumbering men suggests they are more engaged in this kind of research, perhaps unsurprising given the level of bias against them.

By drawing Sankey plots comparing bias over 10 years, an optimistic outlook comes through. When shown as a percentage of respondents it is clear that the number of participants in the strong male-career/science bias has decreased with gains in the association of female-career/science.
